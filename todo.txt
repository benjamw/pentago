TODO
------------------

CURRENTLY WORKING ON: get game page html/css built

- don't show success messages if email is not sent for things like
	nudge, that are only email dependent

- figure out a nice way to create invites in the DB

- make the invite page match the DB invites schema

- fix the stats page

- build game reader for saved games

- update scripts
	- use yepnope and cdn

- add showdown to messages (JS port of Markdown, in zz_scripts_js)

- fully convert times to UTC in MySQL and back to user's timezone
	everywhere dates are output

- there are errors when trying to re-send invites
	- make sure everything is working with the invites
		- i didn't find any errors  =(
		- it may be something to do with the resend button being shown
			before it should be, or that the resend time checker is off
			somehow.  it's basically failing due to being too new

- make hover tooltips better
